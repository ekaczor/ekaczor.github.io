    <p>Hello, I'm Evan, and I'm excited to give you a glimpse into my unique journey. My career path has been quite diverse, beginning with a two-year stint as a realtor. Seeking more hands-on problem-solving challenges, I transitioned to a role as Carpenter and later to a Production Coordinator in the fire and water restoration industry for 5 years. However, I felt the call of coding, where the power of the mind in solving complex problems fascinated me. </p>
    <p>
        During my 14-week Java coding bootcamp with WeCanCodeIT, I had the privilege of collaborating with other passionate coders to tackle challenges together. The experience ignited my enthusiasm for the limitless potential of software engineering. Witnessing the incredible strides in technology, even in my young age, leaves me in awe of the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>
    <p>
        Beyond coding, you'll find me enjoying various interests, from playing tennis and darts to hitting the gym for a good workout. I'm also a proud dog parent to Phoebe, my energetic two-year-old Wheaten Terrier. Looking ahead, my goal is to continue my learning journey until I reach the point where I can serve as a Senior engineer, helping young enthusiasts like myself navigate the exciting world of technology.</p>
    <p>
        Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to connecting with you and sharing our shared passions and experiences. </p>
